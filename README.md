<h1>osTicket: Creating and Working Tickets</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
In the last part of the osTicket project, we go through the life cycle of a ticket from creation, to resolution. We'll make changes to the tickets when necessary like assigning the tickets, changing the SLA (Service Level Agreement), and commenting to create a thread of clear communication.<br />
